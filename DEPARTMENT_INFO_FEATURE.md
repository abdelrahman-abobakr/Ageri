## üíª Usage Examples

### Python Example
```python
import requests

# Get simplified department info
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/organization/departments/1/info/')
if response.status_code == 200:
    dept_info = response.json()
    
    print(f"Department: {dept_info['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {dept_info['description']}")
    
    for lab in dept_info['labs']:
        print(f"\nLab: {lab['name']}")
        print(f"Head: {lab['head_name']}")
        print(f"Description: {lab['description']}")
        
        print("Researchers:")
        for researcher in lab['researchers']:
            print(f"  - {researcher['name']} ({researcher['position']})")
```

### JavaScript/React Example
```javascript
// Fetch department info for navigation component
async function getDepartmentInfo(departmentId) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/organization/departments/${departmentId}/info/`);
        const deptInfo = await response.json();
        
        return deptInfo;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching department info:', error);
        return null;
    }
}

// React component example
function DepartmentNavigation({ departmentId }) {
    const [deptInfo, setDeptInfo] = useState(null);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        getDepartmentInfo(departmentId).then(setDeptInfo);
    }, [departmentId]);
    
    if (!deptInfo) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    
    return (
        <div className="department-nav">
            <h2>{deptInfo.name}</h2>
            <p>{deptInfo.description}</p>
            
            <div className="labs">
                {deptInfo.labs.map(lab => (
                    <div key={lab.id} className="lab-item">
                        <h3>{lab.name}</h3>
                        <p>Head: {lab.head_name}</p>
                        <div className="researchers">
                            {lab.researchers.map(researcher => (
                                <span key={researcher.id} className="researcher">
                                    {researcher.name} ({researcher.position})
                                </span>
                            ))}
