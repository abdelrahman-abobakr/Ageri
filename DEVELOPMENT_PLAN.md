3. `organization` - Departments, labs, organizational structure
4. `training` - Courses, summer training, public service
5. `services` - Special tests, client data, technician assignments
6. `content` - Announcements, posts, general content
7. `core` - Shared utilities, base models, common functionality

## Database Design

### Core Entities Identified:
1. **User** (Custom with roles: Admin, Moderator, Researcher)
2. **UserProfile** (CV, ORCID, notes, publications)
3. **Department** (Name, description, head)
4. **Lab** (Name, department, equipment, researchers)
5. **Publication** (Title, authors, status, approval)
6. **Announcement** (Title, content, author, date)
7. **Course** (Name, description, price, instructor)
8. **Service** (Name, description, price, technician)
9. **Client** (Contact info, services used)

### Key Relationships:
- User ‚Üí UserProfile (One-to-One)
- Department ‚Üí Lab (One-to-Many)
- Lab ‚Üî Researcher (Many-to-Many through assignment)
- Researcher ‚Üí Publication (One-to-Many)
- Service ‚Üî Technician (Many-to-Many)

## Security Considerations
- Role-based permissions with Django groups
- Admin deletion protection (ensure at least one admin exists)
- File upload validation and security
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

---

## Next Steps
1. **AWAITING APPROVAL**: Environment setup and requirements.txt creation
2. **AWAITING APPROVAL**: Django project structure and initial apps
3. **AWAITING APPROVAL**: Database model design details

---

## Notes
- Focus on backend completion before frontend
- Each app will be developed and tested independently
- Admin interface will be enhanced for better UX
- API documentation will be generated automatically
